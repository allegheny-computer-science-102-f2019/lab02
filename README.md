Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this repository contains the starter files for Lab 2 in Computer Science 102.

## Summary

This assignment requires a programmer to design a command-line calculator application in a program, called `calculator_i.py`, that will allow the user to enter two numbers and then apply the desired mathematical operator to perform a calculation. For this assignment, the programmer must implement a method and functions to determine which mathematical operator has been requested by the user and then to perform the particular calculation using the inputted numbers. The programmer is also responsible for testing the program to ensure it satisfies the required output.

A carefully formatted assignment sheet for this project provides more details about the steps that a programmer should take to complete this assignment. You can view this assignment sheet by visiting the listing of laboratories on the course web site.

## Learning

To do well on this assignment, you should  review Chapter 4 (Stavely ) and Chapter 1 (Saha) of the course textbooks and the relevant course slides. Please see the course instructor or one of the teaching assistants if you have questions about any of these reading assignments.


## Assistance

If you are having trouble completing any part of this project, then please talk with either the course instructor or a teaching assistant during the lab session. You can also schedule a meeting during the course instructor's
office hours.
